<p>Abstract: The collection of patient-generated health data has become more common through tracking apps and wearables, such as Fitbits. While these devices collect and arrange data through simplified visualizations to aid user comprehension of the data, their true understandability is unknown. This pilot study aimed to explore the Fitbit Inspire 2 watch along with the Fitbit app to determine the usefulness and perception of current visualizations of sleep data. The study assessed user feedback through two rounds of data collection. Feedback data from a focus group and semi-structured interviews revealed five sweet points and four major pain points. The themes determined in this study informed design and visualization recommendations to improve the usability and understandability of Fitbit sleep data visualizations. </p>
