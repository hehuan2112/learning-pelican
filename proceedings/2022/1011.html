<p>Abstract: Poor sleep patterns have been commonly linked to college students. However, this study targets a gap in literature by exploring the sleep patterns in pre-medicine college students. Using self-report measures, studentï¿½s perception on their sleep quality and stress level was measured, along with their Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score. The collected data was analyzed via R-shiny visualization system. As a result, pre-med students turned out to sleep for an adequate duration but had poor sleep quality. They also experienced worse sleep than they had perceived.  Hence, there is a need for self-monitoring amongst pre-meds to increase awareness and sleep hygiene.</p>
