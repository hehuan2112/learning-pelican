Visualizing Beyond the Frontiers of Healthcare
----------------------------------------------

**Victor Lin, MD, MS, FAMIA**

“A picture is worth a thousand words.” This is the time-honored adage that reflects the human brain’s immense capacity to efficiently receive and interpret visual information. With the ever-increasing data quantity and complexity within healthcare, data visualization becomes an invaluable tool to enable healthcare providers and organizations to make informed decisions which optimize the health of individuals and the population, as well as business practices. Furthermore, emerging capabilities such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and natural language processing (NLP) showcase the tremendous power of healthcare data analytics. Visualization incorporating these capabilities harnesses this power, and truly pushes the frontiers of visual analytics and health informatics. When it comes to the future of healthcare data visualization and data analytics, the sky is the limit.

Victor is a United States Navy physician with combat experience. Board-certified and fellowship-trained in clinical informatics, he is a Fellow of AMIA intensely passionate about applying technology to improve healthcare and health. Victor currently serves as the Chief Medical Informatics Officer for the Pacific region of Navy Medicine. In this role, Victor continuously pushes the frontiers of what is possible with health informatics and analytics, leading the development and implementation of not only clinical information systems for hospitals and clinics, but also unique solutions for our Fleet and Fleet Marine Forces. In his spare time, he enjoys traveling the world with his wife Diana who is a fellow informaticist.
