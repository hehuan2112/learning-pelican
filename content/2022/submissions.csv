1006,podium,"Darius Coelho, Nikita Gupta, Eric Papenhausen, Klaus Mueller",Patterns of Social Vulnerability â€“ An Interactive Dashboard to Explore Risks to Public Health on the US County Level,"Social vulnerability is the susceptibility of a community to be adversely impacted by natural hazards and public health emergencies, such as drought, earthquakes, flooding, virus outbreaks, and the like. Climate change is at the root of many recent natural hazards while the COVID-19 pandemic is still an active threat. Social vulnerability also refers to resilience, or the ability to recover from such adverse events. To gauge the many aspects of social vulnerability the US Center of Disease Control (CDC) has subdivided social vulnerabilities into distinct themes, such as socioeconomic status, household composition, and others. Knowing a communitys social vulnerabilities can help policymakers and responders to recognize risks to community health, prepare for possible hazards, or recover from disasters. In this paper we study social vulnerabilities on the US county level and present research that suggests that there are certain combinations, or patterns, of social vulnerability indicators into which US counties can be grouped. We then present an interactive dashboard that allows analysts to explore these patterns in various ways. We demonstrate our methodology using COVID-19 death rate as the hazard and show that the patterns we identified have high predictive capabilities of the pandemic's local impact.",11/5/22,Proceedings of the 2022 Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2022)
1001,podium,"Adriana Arcia, Daniel Chen, Katherine South",Browser-based Infographic Tailoring Self-service Interface (BITSI),"Tailored infographics are useful tools for communicating health information to patients and research participants, particularly those with low health literacy, but software is required to automate the tailoring. The Browser-based Infographic Tailoring Self-service Interface (BITSI) is a bespoke software solution for tailoring infographics. BITSI produces batches or single PDFs of tailored infographics in English and Spanish of Asthma Control Test scores at one or two time points using a number line format. This opensource software uses R and a LaTeX compiler; development of a Shiny web application supported a user-friendly, browser-based interface. We improved upon previous infographic tailoring solutions by streamlining installation and creating a user-friendly point-and-click data entry interface. Due to its interface, BITSI is amenable to interfacing with other systems through application programming interfaces, such as with electronic health record systems. These improvements make deployment of tailored infographics in clinical and research settings feasible and practical.",11/5/22,Proceedings of the 2022 Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2022)
1021,podium,"Danny T.Y. Wu, Derek Shu, Khanh Le, Ruthik Abbu, Kai Zheng",Applying Visual Analytics to Develop a Clinical Workflow Analysis Tool (CWAT) to Explore Time and Motion Data in Healthcare,"Understanding clinical workflow is a crucial first step to improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of patient care delivery. It enables quality improvement processes and provides a basis to compare and quantify workflow improvements. A common source of data for studying clinical workflow is through time and motion studies, which generates multi-dimensional datasets that are challenging to analyze. Visual analytics can be an effective technique to show patterns and bottlenecks in the time and motion data. Moreover, workflow analysis often involves mixed-method design. The triangulation between the quantitative and qualitative data would require the support of a powerful data exploration tool. To address these challenges, we applied visual analytics to develop a clinical workflow analysis tool (CWAT) that allowed for easy identification of significant workflow patterns. In this system demonstration paper, we describe the visualization design choices and validation through case studies",11/5/22,Proceedings of the 2022 Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2022)
1009,podium,"Ha-Kyung Kong, Ruijia Zhu, Audrey Zhixin Lu, Mingao He, Weichao Yuwen",The Effects of Data Visualization on User Perceptions of a Health Chatbot,"Chatbots are increasingly used in healthcare as an accessible and scalable means to communicate information. While visualization can provide summaries of health data, their impact on the comprehension, perceived usefulness, and trustworthiness of chatbots is yet unknown. We examined the effects of visualization (intervention group) of health data compared to text-only representation (control group) among 96 family caregivers in a randomized controlled trial. The results showed that visualizing the relationship between symptom levels (e.g. stress) and health solutions had a significant impact on the comprehension of the health trends and the perceived effectiveness of the solution. While there was an increased trust level in the visualization group, the difference was not statistically significant. The qualitative feedback aligned with the quantitative results. We discussed future directions in leveraging the synergistic effects of visualization and chatbots to increase health literacy and encourage technology adoption.",11/5/22,Proceedings of the 2022 Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2022)

Richardson",Evaluation of Data Visualizations for an Electronic Patient Preferences Tool for Older Adults Diagnosed with Hematologic Malignancies,"Patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies account for 10% of cancer related deaths. The growth of treatment options for hematologic malignancies has led to increased focus on treatment decision-making. However, little research has been done integrating patient-generated data and shared decision making to facilitate patient-clinician collaboration and understand patient preferences in cancer care. Our study aims to develop and evaluate data visualizations to support an electronic healthcare tool (EHT) to facilitate patient understanding of treatment outcomes using human-centered design methods. Data visualizations were developed and updated based on feedback from healthy volunteers, older adults with hematologic malignancies (patients), caregivers, and clinicians. We conducted a content analysis on the qualitative data gathered from participants. Our findings showed that users preferred easy to understand visualizations with simple, explanatory text compared to visualizations that were not immediately intuitive. Users also preferred visualizations that were more reflective of the individual's cancer treatment rather than a comparison to the patient population. Iterative improvements were made to the visualizations to reflect user feedback and will be used to inform the next iteration of visualizations for user testing in the clinic. This paper demonstrates the benefit of human- and user-centered design to iterate on data visualizations used to support a patient preference tool.",11/5/22,Proceedings of the 2022 Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2022)
1045,podium,"Humayera Islam, Xiaoxia Li, Kamruz Zaman Rana, Khuder Alaboud, Tanmoy Paul, Abdullah Maruf, Abu Saleh Mohammad Mosa",An In-depth Needs Analysis to Design a Data Visualization Dashboard Prototype for Critical Care Setting,"Intensive Care Units (ICUs) regularly generate a high volume of data for their patients. ICU care providers often find interpreting and presenting the voluminous data generated to be timeconsuming during daily care routines. In the same light, a medical ICU at the University of Missouri (MU) Hospital in Columbia, Missouri, employed a visualization dashboard for effective team communication from easily accessible patient data visualization. However, the current dashboard has been underutilized due to many internal and external factors. Therefore, we aimed to redesign the ICU data visualization dashboard called IC-DASH that can overcome the challenges in the existing dashboard and seamlessly integrate it into the workflow of critical care. This paper presents the steps of an in-depth needs analysis implemented to build an ICU data visualization prototype called IC-DASH.",11/5/22,Proceedings of the 2022 Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2022)
1000,poster,"Natthawut (Max) Adulyanukosol, David Gotz",Expanding the existing Cadence event visual analysis tool to support the standardized data model OMOP CDM,"The differences in health data models obstruct the use of analytics tools on new datasets or at other institutions. This work presents a data conversion tool that converts data from the standardized Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) to be compatible with the existing Cadence event visual analysis tool. The tool is available as a web-based application with an interactive data quality report, which makes the data conversion process more observable visually. Users may detect anomalies and unexpected data distributions in the converted data, and solve the issues prior to uploading the data to Cadence. This conversion and visual assessment concept could be applied to other existing analytics tools in healthcare by leveraging the OMOP CDM, and could improve data quality for subsequent analyses.",11/5/22,Proceedings of the 2022 Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2022)
1002,poster,"Abraham Kim, Scott Bonnette, Chen Xin, Victoria L. Graham, Kelsey Logan, Danny T.Y. Wu",Examining Athletic Trainers' Impact on Student Athlete Emergency Room and Urgent Care Visits Using Electronic Health Records and Visual Analytics,"Athletic Trainers (ATs) are crucial to the process of coordinating care and preventing injuries for student athletes. Despite this, not all high schools have ATs for various reasons. Therefore, it is imperative to examine the impact of ATs. In this mixed methods study, we examine student athleteï¿½s electronic health records (EHRs) and conduct semi-structured interviews to determine the influence of AT presence on the number of Emergency Room visits. To facilitate the statistical analysis of the quantitative data, a R-shiny application was developed utilizing visual analytics. This application allowed the research team to explore with the EHR data through interactive visualization and see statistical comparison results immediately. The R-shiny application is being refined to further explore the data and provide empirical evidence to the qualitative themes.",11/5/22,Proceedings of the 2022 Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2022)

However, this study targets a gap in literature by exploring the sleep patterns in pre-medicine college students. Using self-report measures, studentï¿½s perception on their sleep quality and stress level was measured, along with their Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score. The collected data was analyzed via R-shiny visualization system. As a result, pre-med students turned out to sleep for an adequate duration but had poor sleep quality. They also experienced worse sleep than they had perceived.  Hence, there is a need for self-monitoring amongst pre-meds to increase awareness and sleep hygiene.",11/5/22,Proceedings of the 2022 Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2022)
